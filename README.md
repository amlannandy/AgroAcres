## AgroAcres

AgroAcres is an app-based platform which promotes Smart Agriculture among Indian Farmers

## Problem Statement

Suicide rates of farmers are increasing day by day. Main reason behind this being slow upgradation in the Agriculture Secture, and also
lack of awareness among Farmers about Modern Agricultural Practices.

## Tech Stack

1. Flutter - The skelton of the project. We're using Flutter to save development time while simultaneously building the App for both Android and iOS.
2. Firebase - We use Firebase, a BaaS (Backend as a Service) as our backend as it provides many features such as Phone Authentication, Cloud Storage, no-SQL Dtaabase and Cloud Messaging out-of-the-box that we require in this project
3. Natural Language Processing - The Chatbot in this project was creating entirely using IBM's Watson Assistant.
